# My First Full Stack App

This project was to build out an entire full stack todo list using the PERN stack.

Created a RESTful API to use as the backend of my app.
All the todos/tasks were stored in a database table todopern using PostgreSQL.

It is important to have a basic understanding of the dependencies used in this project.

The dependencies used in the project will be listed below

vite@latest react pg cors express bootstrap popperjs/core sass

The whole project was created with the reference to this video made by Henry from freeCodeCamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8&t=1625s

The only big difference is using Vite to use react instead of Create React App.

Either pay close attention to what has been changed in the files as compared to the original state of vite@latest.

Installing bootstrap is also done another way but reference the official bootstrap page for a step by step guide: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/vite/ instead of what is shown in the video.
